# Visualizing Grades

The goal of this project is to create a website that help visualize the grading distribution of some courses at UCSB. Please see the a visualization [on Github page of this repository](https://sir-teo.github.io/visualizing-grades/).

## How to Run Locally

For now, the visualization is made with d3.js, so to build yourself run

```
npm install d3
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

I tried to answer the some "big questions" like "Are there GPA inflations." with simple data analysis. To see the code that generate the graph, please see this [analysis page](https://sir-teo.github.io/visualizing-grades/analysis.html). 

To begin with, we define

$$
\text{A Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of people getting A's}}{\text{Total Number of People}}
$$

and 

$$
\text{Fail Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of people who fail}}{\text{Total Number of People}}
$$

### Which professor tend to give A's and Which tend to give fails

### How hard it is to get an A/ fail a course in a department?

#### A Rate by major

![A rate by major](./figures/A_Rate_Dept.png)

The top A rate majors are **Muisc Performance Laboratories**, **Military Science**, **German**, **Hebrew**, **Russian**, **Environmental Science and Management**.

#### Fail Rate by major

![Fail rate by major](./figures/Fail_Rate_Dept.png)

The top fail rate majors are **Astronomy**, **Math**, **Chemistry**, **MCDB**, **PSTAT**, **Psychology**, **EEMB**.

- Do GPA inflation exist at UCSB?

#### A rate by quarter

![A rate by quarter](./figures/A_Rate_Quarter.png)

#### Fail rate by quarter

![Fail rate by quarter](./figures/Fail_Rate_Quarter.png)

We see that there seem to be GPA inflation in the past 10 years. And the pandemic bumped the GPA a bit.
